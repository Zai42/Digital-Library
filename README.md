# Data Collection Journey
It was the month of December, 2019. I was assigned a project of collecting data from an organization and creating a normalized database from the gathered data. I went to the Library of PIET University and gathered requirements in the form of SRS(Software Requirement Specification). Then I collected all the possible data(about books) that can be used on a website(to display complete book details). Later I added demo data to the table just to test the functionality and layout of my website.
